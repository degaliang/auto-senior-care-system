# Autonomous Senior Helper System for Enhanced Safety and Well-Being

## Our Focus
We currently focus on developing a Computer-Vision-based fall detection system and can detect human falls regardless of any occlusions in the scene. More specifically, we are working on a generic action recognition algorithm with application on fall detection. This algorithm should be easy to generalize to detect other medical emergencies like heart attacks.
